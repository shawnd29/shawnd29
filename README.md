## Hello ðŸ‘‹

It's really great to reach out! My name is Shawn, a data and analytics enthusiast and always excited to learn on all things data; when I am not busy cooking something interesting.


> ## Things about me 


- :computer: &nbsp; I predominately code in Python, but love pulling my data through SQL.
- ðŸŒ±  &nbsp; Iâ€™m currently building on my concepts in Data Science and analytics.
- ðŸ‘¯  &nbsp; Iâ€™m aiming to build my skills through projects based on Machine Learning.
- ðŸ’¬  &nbsp; Ask me about anything. If I didn't know maybe I will learn something new!

- âš¡ Fun fact: Cooking and bathroom singing are some of my biggest passions.


Do take a look at my projects and let me know if there is something that catches your eye.
